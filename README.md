# reg-frontend

## development

Note: On Windows, both projects need to be checked out with, `git config core.autocrlf input` or they won't build correctly.

### first time

#### Configure access to the GitHub npm registry

One of our dependencies is `@eurofurence/reg-component-library`, which we only publish to the private GitHub packages
registry.

To configure access, obtain a GitHub personal access token with `read:packages` scope permissions. With that, do

```
echo "//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_TOKEN}" >> ~/.npmrc
```

#### install gatsby and dependencies

```
npm install -g gatsby-cli
gatsby telemetry --disable

npm install
```

_Note: running node/npm from snaps may not work. Some problem with user detection when installing sharp, where it tries
to install as the wrong user and then runs into permission errors._

#### set up a local dotenv

```
cp .example.env.development .env.development
```

Edit this new file and fill in the env vars with the test env information.

### run locally

```
npm start
```

Then point your browser to http://localhost:8000/register

### server-like installation on localhost

You can run locally together with one or more of the backend services (most likely you'll want at least
reg-attendee-service and reg-payment-service).

See the instructions [here](https://github.com/eurofurence/reg-regsys-classic), as well as the readme's of the
backend services.

Then you can use the system exactly as it is installed on the server by pointing your browser to http://localhost:10000/register

This also lets you avoid any CORS issues because everything is coming from the same domain.

### webpack build and upload to the server (ci)

In `gatsby-config.js`, set the correct `pathPrefix`. Then do

```
PREFIX_PATHS=true npm run build
```

This will generate a full static version of the site into `public`, which you can then tar.gz and upload to the server
for roll-out with a script similar to this one (assuming you have ssh-agent running and have access):

```
# build application with prefix paths as configured
PREFIX_PATHS=true npm run build

# upload and roll out
tar czf public.tgz public
scp public.tgz regtest@reg.eurofurence.org:projects/
ssh regtest@reg.eurofurence.org -t "bash -l -c 'scripts/update-app.sh'"
rm -f public.tgz
```

### other commands

```
# run the typescript compiler to check for type errors
npm run tsc

# run the linter to check for warnings and errors
npm run lint
```
