				In order to speed up hotel booking and increase your chances of securing a room, you can enter your preferred dates,
				hotel room, contact and guest information on the following pages. We will then generate an email template for you,

				Once booking starts, the secret code in the message below will be revealed.
				You need this code for the hotel to accept your booking.
